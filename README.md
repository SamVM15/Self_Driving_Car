# Self_Driving_Car

The program makes a 2D self driving car where the user can draw the lines of the "road" and the car will learn how to drive. 

The code is based off a AI course on Udmey that I'm taking. I followed along the videos, so for the vast majority of the code, I did not come up with it myself. I do, however, understand what each line does and added comments and a few small changes to variables.
